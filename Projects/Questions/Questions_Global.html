<li>  Why are global variables avoided? </li>
      Global variables are mutbale and may be changed inside local functions or block statements enclosed in {} braces, which may result in unexpected errors or even crash. 
      <br> <br>
<li>  Explain JavaScript's strict mode </li>
      JavaScript uses 'use strict' to invoke the strict mode. When strict mode is enabled, some previously-accepted mistakes are treated as errors mode, which helps fix the problems rapidly. For example, a variable is declared without the 'let' or 'const' keyword, an error will be triggered. <br> <br>
<li> What are side effects, and what is a pure function? </li>
     A pure function is a special kind of functions, which the values of input and return arguments are not changed. In other words, their values are the same before and after calling a pure function.
